# Access, Encapsulation, Scope

## Review

### Scope 
- In Java, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. 
This is called scope.

Local variables can only be used within the scope that they were defined in.

### Access 
- Access refers to Java access specifiers public, private, protected and a default access level.
The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. 
We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it. 

### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes. 
Its aim is to create small bundles of logic.

### `this` Keyword

The this keyword can be used to designate the difference between instance variables and local variables.
The this keyword can be used to call methods when writing classes.
